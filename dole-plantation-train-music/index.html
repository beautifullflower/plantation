(1 months ago) visited the dole plantation on nov 17th using the gooahu card (free entrance and train ride using this card, i highly recommend it). We did not take the train tour around the plantation because of time constraints. Book your tickets online for dole plantation, wahiawa: Also, there were colorful flowers to see.</p>

<p>Pin on 3DHD Wallpaper There is no entry fee, rather you just pay for the activities you would like to participate in. Guaranteed sightings of sea turtles, plus a snorkeling tour and catamaran cruise, make this guided tour the ultimate hawaiian experience. You can purchase tickets for the individual attractions or buy a combination package for a better deal. The train trip was great, 22 minutes of cruising around the plantation and hearing a cheesy audio guide, loved it! There is an overflowing abundance of dole whip here. The grounds are beautiful and the dole whip (think pineapple ice cream) was worth the visit.</p>

<p>farm today Farm, Railroad tracks, Australia The tour itself is a recording telling you the history of dole plus advertisement to buy a music cd that lasts 20 minutes through the plantation. The koi pond is a nice little walk and the koi are huge. You get to see where they harvest all of their crops and listen to some hawaiian music along the way. The dole plantation has three paid attractions. Each pineapple plant is used to harvest three different pineapples over about 45 months. Drove out to dole plantation.</p>

<p>What to do in Oahu Hawaii Oahu hawaii, Hawaii food, Oahu Instead, we enjoyed the dole whip offered at the store. Hawaii�s complete pineapple experience and home to the world�s largest maze, pineapple express train and the plantation gardens. We did not take the train tour around the plantation because of time constraints. I would not worry about buying tickets in advance or wait in a long line for this one. The dole plantation is an attraction on the island of oahu, hawaii. Choose from a morning tour or midday tour</p>
