<p>Pin on Great photos Joseph plantation was very interesting and the whitney museum is something that every american should see. 400 esplanade avenue, new orleans. Transportation provide by “legendary tours” Visitors meet their guide in the welcome center, which also serves as a tasteful gift shop, primarily offering books on slavery. A compelling and authentic presentation of slavery on a louisiana sugar plantation. It’s about an hour drive from new orleans but jim made the time pass by quickly with his historical knowledge and quick wit.</p>
