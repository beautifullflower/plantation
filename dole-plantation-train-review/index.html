<p>Pin on Picture Perfect Our overall package to do the train, the garden and the maze was like $24 per person. Drove out to dole plantation. It�s a great place to teach your kids some survival skills. You can purchase tickets for the individual attractions or buy a combination package for a better deal. What is the secret to this incredible pineapple soft serve? We got lost but that was the fun of it.</p>

<p>Things to do at Dole Plantation hawaii pineapples. oahu Took train ride tour.line was long but it was interesting. Our overall package to do the train, the garden and the maze was like $24 per person. The dole whip is better than anywhere else, including disneyland. They have a gift shop and a pineapple garden with different types you can take pictures. The pineapple plantation also offers a tour via the pineapple express train, a dole plantation maze, a pineapple garden, pineapple cutting demonstrations, and fish feeding pond, but the real reason to stop in is…. Took train ride tour.line was long but it was interesting.</p>

<p>Pin on Dole Plantation Check out updated best hotels &amp; restaurants near dole plantation. There is an overflowing abundance of dole whip here. But the highlight was the dole whip!! The pineapple plantation also offers a tour via the pineapple express train, a dole plantation maze, a pineapple garden, pineapple cutting demonstrations, and fish feeding pond, but the real reason to stop in is…. The dole plantation was our last stop of our oahu tour. Instead, we enjoyed the dole whip offered at the store.</p>
